Guidelines for contributing to the CLAC project.

## Note from the author

CLAC began as a simplification of a common problem that I faced while writing
difficult-to-configure applications.  I wrote this selfishly to solve my own
problems.  Hopefully, this has helped you solve some similar problem of your
own.

While I do not expect any outside user to contribute their time and energy to
this project, I greatly appreciate it when it does happen.  Even taking the
time to file an issue can help me to identify problems which may affect me,
and any others who depend on this project.

For those wonderful people who would like to help by reporting issues,
submitting bugfix patches, adding to documentation or unit tests, or helping
to maintain the project itself, here are some guidelines to help you get
through the process smoothly.

## Issues/Enhancements

CLAC uses [Github Issue Tracking](https://github.com/scruffystuffs/clac/issues)
to track issues and minor enhancements.  Please follow the issue templates
found there to make sure your voice is heard.

Issues/Enhancements which do not contain the requested information will be
closed after 72 hours, unless the information is provided within that time.
Fields which do not apply should be filled with the reason for their lack of
validity.  For example, if you found a spelling error in the documentation,
there would be no need to include any platform information or code snippets.
In those sections, you would simply write "Not related to code." or
"Independent of platform." This greatly helps the owner to triage those items
quickly, which prevents valid issues from being ignored.

## Submitting patches

Bugfix patches are taken exclusively through pull requests, except from the
project owner.  That person must use merge requests for all major enhancements,
(which may only be contributed by the owner), and must use pull requests for
all other enhancements/fixes.

A more formal pull request process will be put into place once the project
grows to justify it, but for now, simply
[create an issue](https://github.com/scruffystuffs/clac/issues),
[fork the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/),
[setup a CLAC dev environment](),
and finally, create a
[pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).
